# Verilog Gate Testing Project

This project is designed to test various logic gates using Verilog. Verilog is a hardware description language used to model electronic systems. In this project, we will be testing the functionality of AND, OR, and NOT gates.

## Getting Started

To run the tests, simply type `./test.sh` in your terminal. This will compile the Verilog code and run the simulation.

## Understanding Verilog

Verilog is a hardware description language used to model electronic systems. It allows designers to describe the behavior of a circuit in a high-level language, which can then be compiled into a low-level representation that can be used to program an FPGA or ASIC.

## Testing Gates

In this project, we will be testing the functionality of AND, OR, and NOT gates. These gates are fundamental building blocks of digital circuits, and are used to perform logical operations on binary data.

### AND Gate

The AND gate takes two inputs and produces an output that is high (1) only if both inputs are high. Otherwise, the output is low (0).

### OR Gate

The OR gate takes two inputs and produces an output that is high (1) if either input is high. If both inputs are low, the output is low (0).

### NOT Gate

The NOT gate takes a single input and produces an output that is the opposite of the input. If the input is high (1), the output is low (0), and vice versa.
